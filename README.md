# weather_app
This repository contains a multi-page Streamlit web application that demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow. The application handles everything from rate-limited API data collection and CSV storage to interactive data exploration, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

The primary goal is to predict weather conditions (e.g., 'Rain', 'Clouds') based on historical and real-time data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API
